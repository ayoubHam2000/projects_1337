when a process dies, voluntarily or unvoluntarily, the sem_close operation occurs automatically.

sem_unlink removes the named semaphore, and will destruct the semaphore once its reference count is 0. That is after all process that opened it have called sem_close or have exited.

How to get the full returned value of a child process?

The short answer is that you pretty much can't. Traditionally, the exit status of a process under Unix/Linux is propagated as an 8-bit value. You can return any integer from main that you like, you can call exit with any integer that you like, but only the low-order 8 bits are available to the parent via any of the wait functions.
