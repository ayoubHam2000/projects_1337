# read 

ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);

The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf. 

if nbyte is zero, the read() function may detect and return errors

In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the read() function shall return zero and have no other results.

If the starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be returned

Upon successful completion, read() shall return a non-negative integer indicating the number of bytes actually read. Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

# Open
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *path, int oflag, ... );

The open() function shall return a file descriptor for the named file that is the lowest file descriptor not currently open for that process..
